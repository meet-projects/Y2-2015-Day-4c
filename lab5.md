MEET Friends Lab 5: Default value for radio buttons and styling with CSS/Bootstrap
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Important:** This lab relies on successfully completed code for [MEET Friends Lab 4](https://github.com/meet-projects/y2-meet-friends/blob/master/lab4.md). You should have a folder `y2-meet-friends`. Also, after running your Flask app, remember that you go to your Flask website by going to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

As a reminder, if you have not set up Python using the commands below, please do so now:

```
wget http://tinyurl.com/MEETpythonY2
source MEETpythonY2
```

If you have already run the code above but you've opened a new terminal window, please run:

```
source ~/y2-venv/bin/activate
```

#### Exercise 1

Make it so that the "edit friend" page automatically selects the current gender of the friend when you load the webpage

#### Exercise 2

Add `<head>` and `</head>` tags at the top of each of the four HTML files, where enclosed within the head tags, there are two stylesheet references, one to Bootstrap, and one to `style.css` that we have provided in the `static` folder (look at the lecture notes for how to obtain the URL of this stylesheet using `url_for`!). After adding these two stylesheet references to the four HTML files, you should find that all four pages now use Bootstrap and that there is a sticky footer on all the pages.
